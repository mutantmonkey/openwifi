openwifi
========

This script automatically accepts terms and conditions on public wifi so you
don't have to open a web browser to connect.

Support is currently limited to `attwifi`, but support for additional networks
will be added in the future.

Prerequisites
-------------
* Python 3.x
* [lxml](http://lxml.de/)

Usage
-----
If you are using Arch Linux and netcfg, you can simply run this script as part
of your `POST_UP` commands. Otherwise, just run this strip after connecting.
